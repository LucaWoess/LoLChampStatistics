# LoLChampStatistics

This program scrapes the names, the categories and the difficulties from all League of Legends characters from the official Website, 
writes them into a MySQL Database, which is created automatically. Afterwards the program reads out the data from the databank and 
visualises it in a bar chart via Javafx.
